Craps on Discord

## Up and running

You must create `config.json` in project root (see template.config.json).

- Test: `npm test`
- Test with REPL: `npm run test-repl`
- Live: `npm start`

## TODO

1. Integrate discord db into app
2. Shooter turns?
3. Timers, AFK handling

### Considerations

- Denominator checking & auto bet/increment by units setting
- Graphics?
