Craps on Discord

## Up and running

You must create `config.json` in project root (see template.config.json).

- Test: `npm test`
- Test with REPL: `npm run test-repl`
- Live: `npm start`

## TODO

1. Finish rest of commands
2. Integrate discord db into app

### Considerations

- Denominator checking & auto bet/increment by units setting
- Graphics?
